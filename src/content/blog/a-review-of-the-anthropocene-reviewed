description: The book you need when everything is falling apart.

It feels like a diary of one of my favorite people in the world whom I got to know about from one of my favorite people on Earth. Every single chapter is a moment of history of significance to the author, similar to going to your grandparents' house and listening while they tell you stories about their lives.

The chapter about Jerry Dorzek in the Milan v Liverpool final made me sob, and believe me, this is the first time I have ever—I mean, ever—cried because of sports. John Green brings us humanity's favorite things about itself and the world around us in small, pocket-sized, anecdote-filled, brilliant writings, leaving you to scramble from one line to another, gasping at the beauty of our world and realizing our own impact on the world around us.
